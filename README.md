# FavouriteDirectories
Command line program to easily set and switch between favourite directories from cmd.

Made as a personal project to advance my knowledge and learn new skills.

How to run:

->Go to "Releases" on the right hand side and click the latest version.

->Download FavouriteDirectories.zip

->Extract to a safe directory

->Add the fav.exe file to the path environment variables.
(On windows this is "Edit the system environment variables" -> "Environment variables" -> "Path" -> "New")

->In Command Prompt, type fav help for commands to get started!

Dependencies to modify:
->C# editor/compiler
